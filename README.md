**Technical Side Of Our Project:**

Our project is an open-source crowdfunding platform powered by the XRP Ledger technology to process all payment transactions as smart contracts on the ripple blockchain. Our main focus is to is to make the entire platform's transactions runs on the blockchain for absolut transperancy. Oru proejct is going to be built as 2 main Components:
1.  Open Source Crowdfunding Platform (Goteo Version 3)
2.  Smart-Contracts Integration With The XRPL

**Our Project's Goals:**
---
1. Take advantage of the XRP Ledger to store the history of all transactions made by doners
2. Keep all donations anonymous to protect the identity of the donators.
3. Take advantage of the XRPL technology to empower our payment processing.
4. Any doner can fetch the history of his donations from the ledger as well as the project owner who received donations.
5. "Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform"

**Our Project's Building Technology:**
---
From a technical side, our project is a **Payment Processor Integration** that will enable our crowdfunding platform to collect all donations and process all payments transactions on the XRP Ledger. For this reason, our project is going to be built on top of 2 main components:

1. **Goteo Version 3, the Open Source Crowdfunding Platform:**
The Goteo platform already gave us a big push forward, as we've been concerned about coding the base platform but thanks to this open-source platform we can dedicate all of our time to building the ledger integration between our platform and the XRP Ledger.

2. **The XRP Ledger Technology:**
We're focusing our energy on building the perfect integration for our platform to make it run on the XRPL. We'd like to make the entire transaction history to be stored in the ledger for safekeeping. 

**The main XRPL Components we're relying on:**
---
1. Accounts: https://xrpl.org/label-accounts.html:
This is crucial: We're going to open an account on the chosen currency where the funded projects are going to receive the donations, later they can choose to withdraw their balance.

2. Cross-currency: https://xrpl.org/label-cross-currency.html
We're happy to say that our platform will support multi-currency donation so both the donator and the funded project owner can choose their favorite currency

3. Transaction Sending: https://xrpl.org/label-transaction-sending.html
Our core function is transactions via the XRPL, this is where all donations are taking place

Our Project is based on an open-source project "Goteo Version 3" an Open Source Crowdfunding Platform. Our mail play is to empower
This platform with the XRPL as a transactions ledger for all donations made throughout the platform.

**How Our Project Will Benefit The XRPL Community?**
---
1. One of our project main componenet is **"Payment Processor Integration"** it going to become a handful open source project that all XRPL community can use and integrates it withing their own proejcts. 
2. Thanks to our open-source license, we believe that we're preapring a preciouse piece of work to the community whom will responde to it with generouse contributions and help us improve it. 
3. Our project will provide an open-source XRPL Integration that the community members can use it to empower their own projects with the XRPL. e.g: if you have a simple paltform that process/store payments transactions, our integration will help you run you payment processing on the XRP Ledger, so you'll have a ready to go solution at your own command.   

**Our Plan Of Licensing Our Work**
One of our proejct main components is an open-source project and we really appriciate this as it gave us a huge junp-off to save us the time and recourse of building it. We don't want our integration to be hard-coded for this platform only! we want all the community to be able to use it for any other project, so we're going to make sure that it's goging to be open for customizations with any other platform, we're going to do the following conserning the licensing:
1. A customized version of our project will remain private for own platform, because 
2. An open-source version will be availble for the XRP community
