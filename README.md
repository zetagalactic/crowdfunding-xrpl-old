# Crowdfunding-xrpl
An open-source crowdfunding project that is powered by the XRP Ledger.

**Project Goals:**
---
1. Take advantage of the XRP Ledger to store the history of all transactions made by doners
2. Keep all donations anonymous to protect the identity of the donators.
3. Take advantage of the XRPL technology to empower our payment processing.
4. Any doner can fetch the history of his donations from the ledger as well as the project owner who received donations.
5. "Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform"

**Our Project Building Components:**
---
From a technical side, our project is a **Payment Processor Integration** that will enable our crowdfunding plaform to collect all donations and process all payments transactions on the XRP Ledger. For this reason our project is going to be built on the top of 2 main components:

1. **Goteo Version 3, the Open Source Crowdfunding Platform:**
The Goteo platform already gave us a big push forward, as we've been concerned about coding the base platform but thanks to this open-source platform we can dedicate all of our time to building the ledger integration between our platform and the XRP Ledger.

2. **The XRP Ledger Technology:**
We're focusing our energy on building the perfect integration for our platform to make it run on the XRPL. We'd like to make the entire transaction history to be stored in the ledger for safekeeping. 

**The main XRPL Components we're relying on:**
---
1. Accounts: https://xrpl.org/label-accounts.html:
This is crucial: We're going to open an account on the chosen currency where the funded projects are going to receive the donations, later they can choose to withdraw their balance.

2. Cross-currency: https://xrpl.org/label-cross-currency.html
We're happy to say that our platform will support multi-currency donation so both the donator and the funded project owner can choose their favorite currency

3. Transaction Sending: https://xrpl.org/label-transaction-sending.html
Our core function is transactions via the XRPL, this is where all donations are taking place

Our Project is based on an open-source project "Goteo Version 3" an Open Source Crowdfunding Platform. Our mail play is to empower
This platform with the XRPL as a transactions ledger for all donations made throughout the platform.
