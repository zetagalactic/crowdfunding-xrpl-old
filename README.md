**Technical Side Of Our Project:**
---
Our project is an open-source crowdfunding platform powered by the XRP Ledger technology to process all payment transactions as smart contracts on the ripple blockchain. Our main focus is to make the entire platform's transactions run on the blockchain for absolute transparency. Our project is going to be built into 2 Main Components:
1.  Open Source Crowdfunding Platform (Goteo Version 3)
2.  Smart-Contracts Integration With The XRPL

  **Our Goals:**
  1. Take advantage of the XRP Ledger to store the history of all transactions made by doners
  2. Keep all donations anonymous to protect the identity of the donators.
  3. Take advantage of the XRPL technology to empower our payment processing.
  4. Any doner can fetch the history of his donations from the ledger as well as the project owner who received donations.
  5. "Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform"

  **Our Backend Technology:**
  From a technical side, our project is a crowdfunding platform to collect all donations and process all payments transactions on the XRP Ledger. For this reason, our project is going to be built on top of 2 main components:

  1. Goteo Version 3, the Open Source Crowdfunding Platform:
  The Goteo platform already gave us a big push forward, as we've been concerned about coding the base platform but thanks to this open-source platform we can dedicate all of our time to building the ledger integration between our platform and the XRP Ledger.

  2. The XRP Ledger Technology:
  We're focusing our energy on building the perfect integration for our platform to make it run on the XRPL. We'd like to make the entire transaction history to be stored in the ledger for safekeeping. 

  **The main XRPL Components we're relying on:**
  Since we're going to run our platform on the blockchain we need the backup of such technology behind us. This is where the XRPL comes in. We rely on this powerful blockchain technology to empower our project. Our Project is based on an open-source project "Goteo Version 3" an Open Source Crowdfunding Platform. Our main play is to empower this platform with the XRPL as our secure transactions ledger for all donations made throughout the platform.
  Below are the main components we're aiming to use:  
 1. Accounts: https://xrpl.org/label-accounts.html:
 This is crucial: We're going to open an account on the chosen currency where the funded projects are going to receive the donations, later they can choose to withdraw their balance.

 2. Cross-currency: https://xrpl.org/label-cross-currency.html
 We're happy to say that our platform will support multi-currency donation so both the donator and the funded project owner can choose their favorite currency

 3. Transaction Sending: https://xrpl.org/label-transaction-sending.html
 Our core function is transactions via the XRPL, this is where all donations are taking place.



**How Our Project Will Benefit The XRPL Community?**
---
1. One of our project's main component is **"Payment Processor Integration"** is going to become a handful of open source project that all XRPL community can use and integrates within their projects. 
2. Thanks to our open-source license, we believe that we're preparing a precious piece of work for the community who will respond to it with generous contributions and help us improve and open new potential for it.
3. Our project will provide an open-source XRPL Integration that the community members can use to empower their projects with the XRPL. E.g: if you have a simple platform that processes/stores any kind of payments transactions, our **XRPL Integration** will help you make all your financial activities tracked and timestamped on the XRPL blockchain so you'll have a secure leader solution that no one can mess with.

**Our Plan Of Licensing Our Work**
---
One of our project's main components is an open-source project and we appreciate this as it gave us a huge jump-off to save us the time and recourse of building it. We don't want our integration to be hard-coded for this platform only! we want all the community to be able to use it for any other project, so we're going to make sure that it's going to be open for customizations with any other platform, we're going to do the following concerning the licensing:
1. A customized version of our project will remain private for our platform, because 
2. An open-source version will be available for the XRP community 

**Key Deliverables & Milestones**
---
**Milestones**

Our project is going to rool out in 2 phases:
A. Developpement & Testing (3-4 Months):
 1. Work on development of the payment integration on the XRPL (first 2 Months)
 2. Publish the initial beta version & gave access to test users (month 2 to 4)
 3. Finilize the production version (month 5)
 4. Put together a marketing strategy to spread our platform service accross the world.
 5. Spread the word about the platform in the XRP communities we are currentlly managing & the ones we're part of. 
 7. Run Marketing Campaigns on selected countries

**Deliverables:**
Our primary milestone is the have a working crowdfunbding platform that run on the blockchain.Online crowdfunding platform that runs on the XRPL
3. Open-source XRPL integration as


**How Dose Our Platform Actually Works?**
---

1. A user create a project or a campaign to rais certain amount of funds.
2. Our team verify the project detail against spam and other certain violations.
3. We create a new account for this project in the XRPL where it's going to recieve money.
4. The website visitors will find the project/campaign listing and will be able to donate using their soft wallet right inside the the project landing page.
5. The project owner will get notified for all recieved donation and will be able to withdrow their raised fund when it reached the desired amount.

That's all!
